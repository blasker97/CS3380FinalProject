### Application Description: 
This application, *Golf Tracker*, was built to serve a golf club to keep records of members and their round history. Upon launch of the application the user must enter their member credentials: a username and password. The user is then redirected to view their game history. This page features: their score on each hole (1-9), their overall round score, and the date in which the round was played. From this screen, the user can open a form to add information for a newly played game, edit previously entered game data, and delete old rounds all together. When at the form to enter in new game data, the user simply inputs their score on each hole and then click on the **submit** button. If the user needs to go back to the game history page they can click on the **cancel** button. Once the user is ready to leave the site they can click on the **logout** button from the game history page.
